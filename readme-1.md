## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For type checking
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I Learned

Working on this project allowed me to solidify my understanding of React and TypeScript integration. Here are some code snippets that I'm particularly proud of:

#### HTML

```html
<h1>Shop our latest collection</h1>
```

#### CSS

```css
.header {
  background-color: #f8f9fa;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

#### JavaScript (React)

```jsx
const handleClick = () => {
  console.log('Button clicked!');
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I aim to delve deeper into:

- Advanced state management using Redux or Zustand
- Improving performance optimization techniques in React
- Enhancing user experience with animations and transitions using Framer Motion

### Useful Resources

- [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - Great for getting started with React.
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/docs) - Helped me with styling React components efficiently.
- [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) - Essential for understanding how to use TypeScript with React.
